<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dinah</h1>
<h3 align="center">Passionate about Data Science for the Common Good</h3>

## ðŸ”­ Current Work
Iâ€™m currently working as **Research Associate at the Centre for Digital Governance at the Hertie School** on Digital Governance and the use of Data Science & AI in the public sector. Further I work as **AI Auditor** for the Responsible AI company BABL AI.

## ðŸŒ± Current Status 
I just finished up my Masters in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, Germany. I am curious about the various ways how data science methods can be used responsibly ro contribute to the common good. Next to the "purely" technical aspects, I am interested in related societal questions of bias, fairness and regulation. Currently, I gained my first practical experiences in data science through various projects that I did during my studies in courses like Introduction to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning or Text as Data, these are the ones that you also find in this repository.

## ðŸ’» Some projects
- [Automated Detection of Energy Infrastructure in Satellite Imagery](https://github.com/Hertie-Thesis-Halkenhaeusser-Rabe/Thesis-Code-Base): my Master Thesis for my MSc. Data Science for Public Policy
- [Why care about Adversarial Attacks](https://github.com/dinahrabe/tutorial_adversarial_attacks): A tutorial for policy makers
- [Where are the Women?](https://github.com/dinahrabe/invisible_women_project): An analysis of Germanys Open Data Portal and its potential gender bias

## ðŸ“„ My professional experiences
I previously worked for two years as Member of the Management Board at the Cyber Innovation Hub, the Digital Innovation Unit of the German Federal Ministry of Defence. Since starting my Masters at the Hertie School I worked in several projects as a Research Associate e.g. on a study on innovation units and innovation ecosystem for the German Chancellery or in a project to support the city of Hamburg in their digital strategy process. I did several internships in the public sector, public sector consulting and management consulting.
