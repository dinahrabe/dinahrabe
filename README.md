<h3 align="center">Prioritizing Human Flourishing in the Age of AI</h3>

## 🔭 Current Work
I’m currently working as **European Market Lead for AI audit and assurance for BABL AI**. A few times a year I am teaching German public servants as **External Lecturer for AI and Data Science at the Hertie School** in Berlin.

## 🌱 Current Status 
I finished up my Masters in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, Germany in summer 2023. I am curious about the various ways how data science methods can be used responsibly ro contribute to the common good. Next to the "purely" technical aspects, I am interested in related societal questions of bias, fairness and regulation. I gained my first practical experiences in data science through various projects that I did during my studies in courses like Introduction to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning or Text as Data, these are the ones that you also find in this repository. Currently, I am developing methodology to run AI bias and performance audits that actually are connected to the socio-technical context of the systems.

## 📄 My professional experiences
I just left my job working as a Data Scienist & Senior Policy Officer for the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development. I previously worked for two years as Member of the Management Board at the Cyber Innovation Hub, the Digital Innovation Unit of the German Federal Ministry of Defence. During my Masters at the Hertie School I worked in several projects as a Research Associate e.g. on a study on innovation units and innovation ecosystem for the German Chancellery or in a project to support the city of Hamburg in their digital strategy process. I did several internships in the public sector, public sector consulting and management consulting.
